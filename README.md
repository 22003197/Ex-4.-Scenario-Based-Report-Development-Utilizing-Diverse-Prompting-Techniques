# Ex-4.-Scenario-Based-Report-Development-Utilizing-Diverse-Prompting-Techniques

## Aim: 
The aim of this project is to demonstrate how scenario-based report development can be enhanced using diverse prompting techniques such as role-based prompting, structured prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and iterative prompting. The goal is to show how these techniques enable the creation of consistent, academic-quality long reports using AI systems.

## Algorithm: 

Step 1: Problem Identification

Understand the scenario and the goal of the report.

Identify the key elements required in the output (AIM, Algorithm, Prompt, Result).

Step 2: Select Prompting Techniques

Use a combination of prompting methods:

Role-based prompting – Assign the AI a specific expert role.

Structured prompting – Provide headings, format, and constraints.

Scenario-based prompting – Describe a situation requiring analysis.

Iterative prompting – Refine the prompt until results match expectations.

Reflective prompting – Ask the model to validate or improve its own output.

Step 3: Design the Scenario Prompt

Include context, task, expected format, and evaluation criteria.

Ensure clarity so that AI responses remain consistent across attempts.

Step 4: Feed Prompt to the Model

Input the final combined prompt to the AI system.

Step 5: Generate and Collect Output

Obtain the AI-produced report.

Check for consistency and correctness.

Step 6: Improve Output

Apply reflective or iterative prompting to refine.

Step 7: Finalize Report

Present results in the required format.

## Prompt:

“Generate a detailed academic-style report (10–15 pages) on the topic ‘Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques’. Include sections such as Introduction, Objectives, Literature Review, Analysis of Prompting Techniques, Algorithm, Framework, Implementation, Results, Advantages, Limitations, Applications, Future Work, and Conclusion. Maintain a clear formal structure.”

## Output:


## Result:

Using the above scenario and prompting techniques, the AI generated a structured, academic-style report containing:

A clear AIM describing the purpose of the scenario and prompting method.

An Algorithm outlining step-by-step procedures for scenario-based report generation.

The exact Prompt used in the model to ensure replicability by an examiner.

The Result, demonstrating how the prompting techniques guided the model to produce a consistent and well-structured answer.

The output successfully shows how diverse prompting strategies help produce more accurate, repeatable, and academically structured reports.
